\usage{
lf_inflator(
  from,
  to,
  check = 1L,
  x = NULL,
  nThread = getOption("grattanInflators.nThread", 1L)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from, to}{Times for which the inflator is desired.}

\item{check}{\code{integer(1)} If \code{0L}, no checks are performed, and
clearly invalid inputs result in \code{NA} in the output. If \code{check = 1L}
an error is performed for bad input; \code{check = 2L} is more thorough.}

\item{x}{(Advanced) A vector that will be inflated in-place. If \code{NULL},
the default, the return vector is simply the inflation factor for `from`.}

\item{nThread}{Number of threads to use.}
