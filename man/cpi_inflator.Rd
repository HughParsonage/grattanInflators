\usage{
cpi_inflator(
  from,
  to,
  adjustment = c("seasonal", "original", "trimmed.mean"),
  fy_month = 3L,
  .from_constant_form = FALSE,
  .to_constant_form = FALSE,
  x = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from, to}{Times for which the inflator is desired.}

\item{adjustment}{Which CPI series to use.}

\item{fy_month}{An integer 1-12, the month to be used for
years and financial years in \code{from} or \code{to}. Since the CPI is a
quarterly series, specifying a year is ambiguous. For
financial years, the month is the month of the financial year,
so for example \code{fy_month = 9} and "2015-16" means Sep-2015,
while \code{fy_month = 6} means Jun-2016.}

\item{.from_constant_form, .to_constant_form}{Are \code{from}, \code{to}
each of constant form? That is, are they all consistently dates,
financial years or are they (possibly) a mixture? If \code{TRUE},
mixtures of formats will raise an error. This is useful
to distinguish financial years from year-month formats (e.g. 2008-09).}

\item{x}{The vector that will be inflated in-place. If \code{NULL},
the default, the return vector is simply the inflation factor for `from`.}
